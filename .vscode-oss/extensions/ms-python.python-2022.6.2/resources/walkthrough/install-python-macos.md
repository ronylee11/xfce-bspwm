# Install Python on macOS

If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, you can install Python by running the following command in the terminal (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd>):

```
brew install python3
```

If you don't have Homebrew, you can download a Python installer for macOS from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/).

To verify if Python was successfully installed, run the following command in the terminal:

```
python3 --version
```
