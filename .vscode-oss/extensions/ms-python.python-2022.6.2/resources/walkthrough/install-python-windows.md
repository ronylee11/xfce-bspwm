## Install Python on Windows

If you don't have Python installed on your Windows machine, you can install it from the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/AAd9rms).

To verify it's installed, create a new terminal (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd>) and try running the following command:

```
python --version
```

You should see something similar to the following:
```
Python 3.9.5
```
