# Configuration

## Background Images

**Background Wallpaper** is probably one of the best features of the plugin.
This feature will set the background image to the current theme's official wallpaper.

**Important!!** Installing theme assets requires me to corrupt VS-Code by modifying CSS. You will have to use the "Remove Sticker/Background" command to restore VS Code back to supported status before unistalling. You can close VSCode and start it back up remove the annoying `Unsupported` warning. The plugin automatically fixes VSCode's checksums.

**Glass Pane effect**

## Hide Watermark

Tired of the the VSCode watermark cramping your style? 
You have the ability to hide it using **Hide VSCode Watermark**, so you can fully enjoy your art.

**Important!!** Hiding the watermark requires me to corrupt VS-Code by modifying CSS. You will have to use the "Remove Sticker/Background" command to restore VS Code back to supported status before unistalling. You can close VSCode and start it back up remove the annoying `Unsupported` warning. The plugin automatically fixes VSCode's checksums.

## Stickers

**Show sticker** allows you to control the presence of the cute sticker in the bottom right-hand corner of your IDE.

## Custom Assets

Hey alright, you have the ability to set the image to be used for all the doki-themes. Allowed image types: jpg, png, gif. You'll have to put these changes in the `settings.json` in your VSCode. 

You can also use the [settings UI](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) just search for `Doki` and you should find the relevant settings.

**Note**: All path values _must_ be an absolute path that resolves to a file on the machine running VSCode. Assets **will not** be installed until the configuration references a file on your system.

**Custom Sticker**

```json
"doki.sticker.path": "C:\\Users\\alex\\Downloads\\aqua_celebration.gif",
```

![Custom Sticker](https://github.com/doki-theme/doki-theme-vscode/raw/HEAD/readmeStuff/custom_sticker.gif)

**Custom Background**

This is the empty editor screen (all tabs closed), the one with the VS Code watermark.

```json
"doki.background.path": "C:\\Users\\alex\\Downloads\\chocola_celebration.gif",
```

![Custom Background](https://github.com/doki-theme/doki-theme-vscode/raw/HEAD/readmeStuff/custom_background.gif)

**Custom Wallpaper**

This shows up on your editor and other places. 
**Note**: you'll want to make your image partially transparent. 
Cus I was too lazy to play make all the backgrounds partially transparent to show the opaque background image. Didn't feel like peeling that onion and deviating from my color schemes.

```json
"doki.wallpaper.path": "C:\\Users\\alex\\Downloads\\ishtar.png",
```

![Custom Background](https://github.com/doki-theme/doki-theme-vscode/raw/HEAD/readmeStuff/custom_wallpaper.png)


**Custom Wallpaper/Background Anchor**

Value to be used for css 'background-position' for both the background & wallpaper (eg: center, right, left, etc.)

```json
"doki.background.anchor": "center",
```

## Asset Restoration

Unfortunately, every time VSCode updates, you will lose your installed asset changes. 
Thankfully, this plugin will remember what assets you installed, and attempt to restore them on the first detection of a VSCode update. 

If the restoration does not work the first time, you can fix the issue then run the **Restore Assets** command to quickly get you back to coding! 

## Suggestive Content

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://doki.assets.unthrottled.io/misc/suggestive/cultured.gif" ></img>
</div>

So I thought it was a good idea to add a bit of culture to this plugin.
<sup><sup>Ya boi is horny on main.</sup></sup>

I will give you a bit of a warning before you install suggestive content.
Some of us are professional Otaku, who want to remain, well...professional.
Don't worry if you choose to continue, I won't ask you again for that specific theme.

Applies for the following content:

- Rias Onyx: Secondary Content


## Remove Assets

Removes both the sticker and wallpaper from your vscode and restores the original supported status.

## Show Changelog
